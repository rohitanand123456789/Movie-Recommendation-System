What is a Recommendation System? 
A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works.
